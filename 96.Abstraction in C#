Abstraction is one of the four pillars of OOP.

It is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features to the user.

In C#, abstraction is achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.

👉 In simple words:

“You only see what you need to use, not how it works inside.”

🔹 Why Use Abstraction?

Hide complexity → Users don’t need to know internal logic.

Reusability → Define common behavior in abstract classes or interfaces.

Flexibility & Maintainability → Internal implementation can change without affecting users.

Polymorphism support → Different classes can implement abstract methods differently.

🔹 Abstraction Using Abstract Class
Example 1: Vehicles
// Abstract class
public abstract class Vehicle
{
    public abstract void Start();   // Abstract method (no body)
    public abstract void Stop();    // Abstract method
}

// Derived class
public class Car : Vehicle
{
    public override void Start()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Car started with key");
    }

    public override void Stop()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Car stopped with brake");
    }
}

// Usage
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Vehicle myCar = new Car();
        myCar.Start(); // Only sees Start method, not internal logic
        myCar.Stop();
    }
}


✅ Here:

Vehicle hides the internal details of starting and stopping.

Car provides the actual implementation.

User only knows “I can start or stop a vehicle”, not how it works internally.

🔹 Abstraction Using Interface
Example 2: Payment System
public interface IPayment
{
    void Pay(decimal amount);  // Abstract by default
}

public class CreditCardPayment : IPayment
{
    public void Pay(decimal amount)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Paid {amount} using Credit Card");
    }
}

public class PayPalPayment : IPayment
{
    public void Pay(decimal amount)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Paid {amount} using PayPal");
    }
}

// Usage
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        IPayment payment1 = new CreditCardPayment();
        IPayment payment2 = new PayPalPayment();

        payment1.Pay(1000); // User doesn’t know internal steps
        payment2.Pay(500);
    }
}


✅ Here:

IPayment defines what a payment can do, not how it does it.

Different payment methods can implement their own logic.

🔹 Real-Life Analogies

TV Remote

You press buttons (essential features)

You don’t need to know how the TV processes signals internally

Car Driving

You press the accelerator, brake, or clutch (essential features)

You don’t need to know how the engine, gears, and fuel system work

ATM Machine

You can withdraw or deposit money (essential functions)

Internal bank processing is hidden

🔹 Difference Between Encapsulation and Abstraction
Feature	Encapsulation	Abstraction
Purpose	Hide data (fields)	Hide implementation (methods/logic)
How	Private fields + public methods	Abstract class or interface
Focus	Data security & controlled access	Only essential functionalities
Example	Bank account balance field	Payment process (CreditCard/PayPal)
